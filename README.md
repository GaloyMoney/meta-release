# Galoy Meta Release ðŸ“¦

This repository groups together the latest stable combination of the [Galoy stack](https://github.com/GaloyMoney/awesome-galoy#tech-components). 
Releases to this repository happen after we complete testing out the individual components on staging and therefore should be good to go together with.

### Stable Release ðŸŽ‰

The components we provide have been grouped into the following lifecycles, using the [charts](https://github.com/GaloyMoney/charts) and the [infra](https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy-infra) repository. 
Source Code diff for the releases will be added soon.
